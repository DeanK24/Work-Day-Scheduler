# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
# <Dean-Ketchmark's-Work-Day-Scheduler>

## Description
This is my Work day scheduler. It has normal business hours listed and you can add tasks you need to do throughout the day to each time block according to when you need to do them or when they need to be done. Then you can hit the save button on the side of the time block and it will save it to localstorage so it won't go away without you clearing it and then hitting save again.
